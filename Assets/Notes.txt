Push/Pull Wooden Crates:
We'll have a old wooden crate for players to use with the PUSH/PULL mechanic of our game. This will
allow players to reach certain area or solve puzzles to advance to the next objective.

Ladder:
The ladder asset will consist of a wooden ladder that will allow player to rise up to the next level or
go back down to where they were before.
